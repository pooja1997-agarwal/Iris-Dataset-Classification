# Iris-Dataset-Classification
Analysis of the Iris dataset and making predictions using various machine learning models of Scikit Learn.
The various algorithms  that were used to make predictions are:-
  1- Logistic Regression
  2- Linear Discriminant Analysis
  3- K Nearest Neighbors
  4- Decision Tree
  5- Naive Bayes
  6- Support Vector Machine
 
K Fold Cross Validation was used to split the dataset into training and test sets.
Linear Discriminant Analysis outperforms all other models and an accuracy of 97.5% was achieved.
